# Matrix multiplication

#### Tested on Sigma

Info | Value
--- | ---
Number of calls *for averaging time* | 64
Time of the whole test | 4h 41m
Time of sequential part of test | 2h 46m
Time of parallel part of test | 0h 13m

Time of the whole tests includes the sleep functions between 
sequential and parallel test and between changing size of data.

Time of each test is computed as `(TIME_1 + TIME_2 + ... + TIME_i) / number_of_calls`, where `i` is number of calls
